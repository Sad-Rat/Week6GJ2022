# OpenGL 2d Game Jam

When you clone make sure you use recurse submodules.
This is a tick box in visual studio or use the option --recurse-submodules at the command prompt.

I've used premake to you need to run buildVS2019projects.bat before you can do anything.
This will make a file called GLGJ.sln you can open in VS2019.
